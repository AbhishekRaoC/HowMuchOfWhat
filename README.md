# *HowMuchOfWhat

### This is a very simple project that asks for an input and gives you the least amount of notes required to store the given amount of money, this currently only works with CHF(Swiss Franc), but I will add more currencies later on.

#####TODO:

- [] Add more currencies
- [] Move everything into functions
- [] Move into Class when done
